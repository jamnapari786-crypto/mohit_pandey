1. Objective

The objective of this assignment is to perform network enumeration on an authorized target in order to identify live hosts, open ports, operating system details, and analyze network traffic using industry‑standard tools.

---

2. Target Scope

The authorized target selected for this security assessment was **certifiedhacker.com**, which is publicly accessible and used strictly for educational and ethical purposes.

---

3. Host Discovery

Command Used:

bash
ping certifiedhacker.com
```

Observations:

* Host is reachable
* 0% packet loss
* Average latency approximately 300 ms

This confirms that the target system is alive and accessible over the network.

---

4. Port Scanning

Command Used:

bash
nmap certifiedhacker.com
```

Result:
Multiple open ports were detected, including:

* FTP (21)
* SSH (22)
* HTTP (80)
* HTTPS (443)
* MySQL (3306)
* PostgreSQL (5432)

This indicates that multiple services are exposed on the target system.

5. Stealth (SYN) Scanning**

Command Used:

bash
nmap -sS -T2 certifiedhacker.com
```

Result:

* Half‑open TCP SYN scan performed
* Reduced chances of detection by IDS/Firewall
* Used for stealth reconnaissance


6. OS Detection

Command Used:

bash
sudo nmap -O certifiedhacker.com
```

Result:

* Linux‑based operating system detected
* OS scan reliability was limited due to filtered ports and firewall restrictions

---

7. Firewall Analysis

Command Used:

bash
nmap -Pn certifiedhacker.com
```

Observations:

* Host discovery bypassed
* Firewall filtering behavior observed
* Some ports were filtered or blocked

---

8. Wireshark Traffic Analysis

Wireshark was used to capture live network traffic on the **eth0** interface during the Nmap SYN scan.

A display filter was applied:

tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
```

The capture shows multiple TCP SYN packets sent from the attacker machine to the target server on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
This confirms that a **TCP SYN Stealth Scan** was successfully performed.

9. Risk Analysis

The target system exposes multiple services publicly, which increases the overall attack surface.

100. Ethical Considerations*

All scanning activities were conducted on an authorized target for educational purposes only. -

11. Conclusion*

This assignment successfully demonstrated host discovery, port scanning, OS detection, firewall analysis, and real‑time traffic analysis using Nmap and Wireshark, following ethical and legal guidelines.
